1. Summary SVMs
 Simple linear sepratable data:
    Perceptron -> Maxima margin -> Quadratic problem -> hard margin solver
    -> Add C to accept some error / noise (soft margin)
 
 Multi-classification: one vs one, ovr
    Kernel tricks: linear, rbf, poly
    How kernel effect on svm
 
2. Implement 
    data:
    feature extractor: bow, how dictionary?
        n_features
        n_examples
    test images:
        n_images
        size
        gray scale

3. Results
    table
    method  kernel  c   gamma   degree  time_fit    score on train  score on test
    
4. Evaluate
data:
    inbalance ? -> effect on result

ovo vs ovr: 
    execution time
    accuracy

C effect on linear (C bigger -> like hard margin)

gamma effect on rbf
    accuray, lable after redict
    
degree effect on poly
    accuray, lable after redict
    
5. How can i improve accuracy
