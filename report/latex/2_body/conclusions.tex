The result accuracy is quite really small and the reason we guess is the simple feature extractor (BOV) we have been implemented. The main goal of the project (summary what we've learned, work on a real dataset to see what we really learned and how those algorithms work together) was archived. Next, we will foucus on changing our feature extractor to improve the result.
